Features
- Built with WPF and C# targeting the .NET Framework for stable Windows desktop compatibility.
- MVVM architecture for clean separation of UI and logic.
- Reusable custom controls and styles for consistent design.
- Theme support (light/dark), high-DPI aware layouts, and vector icons for crisp visuals.
- Smooth animations and transitions to improve UX.
- Localization-ready resource structure.
- Unit tests for core logic (where applicable).

Design & UI Highlights
- Modern, polished look inspired by Fluent and Material principles: clear typography, spacing, and color hierarchy.
- Centralized Resource Dictionaries for colors, styles, and control templates.
- Use of vector icons (Segoe MDL2 / FontAwesome) to keep UI sharp at any scale.
- Smooth, subtle animations for state changes (button hover, list selection).
- Accessibility considerations: keyboard navigation and contrast-aware themes.

Making the design more beautiful — tips
- Adopt a shared ResourceDictionary for colors, font sizes, and margins.
- Use ControlTemplates to replace default WPF chrome for buttons and inputs.
- Consider integrating a lightweight styling library (e.g., MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) if you want polished controls quickly.
- Add a startup animation and subtle elevation shadows for depth.
