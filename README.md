## 👨‍💻 Who I Am

I am a passionate and driven Software Developer focused on creating visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly applications across mobile, desktop, and web platforms. I enjoy learning and working with a variety of frameworks and platforms, and building solutions that solve real problems.

## 🎨 Design & Style

I care about clean UI/UX and consistent design systems. I like to:

- Build responsive layouts with attention to spacing, color contrast, and typography.
- Use component-based design for reusability (React/Next, WPF components, Windows Forms controls).
- Prototype quickly with Expo for mobile and iterate based on user feedback.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills

I have knowledge and hands-on experience with the following technologies:

- WPF (C# on the .NET Framework)
- C# Windows Forms
- VB.NET
- React.js
- Expo (React Native)
- Next.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- TrackPoint — (link: https://github.com/GieExe/TrackPoint) A project demonstrating input handling and UI features.
- ValueVault — (link: https://github.com/GieExe/ValueVault) An example of organizing logic and UI for data management.
